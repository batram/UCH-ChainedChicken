TODO/IDEAS:
  Let host set chain length
   - sync via network

  Chain Teams
  - separately chain players [1 to 2, 3 to 4, ...]

  Modifier menu
    - custom buttons and code

  Wrap up chains in one GameObject

  Play with gravity/mass of players/dead bodies
  - so jumps are easier
  - simpler to drag dead body along

  Apply a/more force through the chain

  Ability to pull on the chain
  - pull while dancing?
  - just shorten the chain or apply force

  Traps 
  - teleport
    - teleport all player at once
  - cannon?
    - add more umpf to player not in cannon
  - blackhole
    - suck chain in?
    - chance for player to break chain, if comrade is sucked in?
    - or spit the dead body out
    
  Collision enabled weirdness
  - players can walk through each other
